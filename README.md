# Journey-of-SQL
Journey of SQL‚Äù is a 30-day hands-on learning project where I explored the fundamentals and advanced features of SQL (Structured Query Language).  Starting from database creation and table design, I practiced core SQL operations including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, filtering with WHERE, joining tables, grouping data, and more.
