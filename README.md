# Journey-of-SQL
Journey of SQL‚Äù is a 30-day hands-on learning project where I explored the fundamentals and advanced features of SQL (Structured Query Language).  Starting from database creation and table design, I practiced core SQL operations including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, filtering with WHERE, joining tables, grouping data, and more. 

# database creation
on the students database i have created a table call student demographic and parent details in that students_demographic i have created a colum s_id which refers to student id,first_name,last_name,age,DOB(date of birth) and by using the "ALTER" is have add another column called gender and the second table i have named as parent details in that i have added father name,mothers name,occupation and salary and using s_id as a "PRIMARY KEY"
by using "ALTER" i have added two column name known as f_age refers to fathers age,m_age refers to mothers age and i have inserted values for both the column using "INSERT INTO","VALUES"

# select statement
in this select statement i have selected both the parent details table and the students demographic table and on to that i have particularly selected a seprate colum and i have praticed a PEDMAS in the sql by using AGE as a value in the select statement sql and to find the distinct value i used the DISTINCT function to gent the values for gender it is used to find the unique values and to than i have used for the distinct value in the same time for first_name and gender in that first name was unique value but gender does not show the unique value because in the given select statement was the both for the both it has seprate uniue vale in this case DISTINCT was can't use properly
 
# where statement
in the where statement i have used the function called "WHERE" to select the particular value of the table it can be also used to alter functions i have used "AND OR NOT" logical operator in the AND operator there the both logic should be true in the OR operator one data value can be true but in AND NOT where the data value should be opposite to the data fo (example: gender in that i use AND NOT gender='male' it means the outcome will show the female values ) same for the OR NOT statement

# like statement
in the like statement i have used the
