# Journey-of-SQL
Journey of SQL‚Äù is a 30-day hands-on learning project where I explored the fundamentals and advanced features of SQL (Structured Query Language).  Starting from database creation and table design, I practiced core SQL operations including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, filtering with WHERE, joining tables, grouping data, and more. 
on the students database i have created a table call student demographic and parent details in that students_demographic i have created a colum s_id which refers to student id,first_name,last_name,age,DOB(date of birth) and by using the "ALTER" is have add another column called gender and the second table i have named as parent details in that i have added father name,mothers name,occupation and salary and using s_id as a "PRIMARY KEY"
by using "ALTER" i have added two column name known as f_age refers to fathers age,m_age refers to mothers age and i have inserted values for both the column using "INSERT INTO","VALUES"
